Saturday Academy's Programming for Beginner's resources

Note: all programs we cover in this class are open-source and free for use.

Scratch: as of now, the current version (2.0) is web-only. You will need to go to http://scratch.mit.edu and click on the create button to work

	Note: for Scratch, some of the screenshots are done in the older version (1.4). Don't worry, the same blocks I used in 1.4 are also in 2.0. The only difference is some of the categories' names have been changed, and 2.0 has new script blocks.
	
Python: you can download python at http://python.org.
	Which version should I use?
	I recommend version 3.3.2 (the latest version as of now).
	However, if you took a class at OGI (near Rock Creek), you used 2.7. Note: all of the programs we did in class would work in either version of Python
	
Alice: We are using Alice 2.3 (the latest stable version). I do not recommend Alice 3 unless you are familiar with Java programming.
	To download: go to http://www.alice.org/index.php?page=downloads/download_alice2.3
	I recommend you download the Alice with textbook worlds. I believe that they have more resources in them.
	Note: with Alice, you don't technically install it. You save a copy of the compressed file and extract it all into a location of your choice (even your flash USB drive)
